	<p>As you walk, the hallway stretches longer with no sign of exit; only locked doors with blank plaques next to each one. You keep walking but it's more of the same. You turn around and see that the hallway behind you has stretched as far as the eye can see. You can hear a shrill beeping noise ecoing through the corridor.</p>
